# Collaboration Assignment 2: Movie Collection
Group: Code4Days (Isaac Copeland, Connor Walsh)
Date: 10/27/2022

This program is designed to allow the user to import and manage a collection of movies organized within a library. 

## How to Run
* Type "make" to compile the program
* Type ./library to run the executable created by the compilation process
* Type "make clean" to remove unwanted files created by the compilation process
* Note: a preformatted, external text file must be provided to utilize one of the program's functions
* When the executable is run, the user will be prompted to select from a menu of options: each of which expect different input.

## How We Shared Work
* We shared the work by simply getting together in the G1 lab to talk about and work on the program.
* Connor wrote most of the code for the assignment, did in-line commentation, and brainstormed.
* Isaac commented the methods, helped brainstorm, and refined the code and documentation for each file.
* We both just had to work on it when possible to get it done on time.
